# Dotfiles and defaults

Learned the hard way that setting your defaults manually is a bad idea if you ever want to do a clean reinstall...

Mostly based on the work of Mathias Bynens: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles
Really interesting repo to dive into in order to learn more about dotfiles in osx.
