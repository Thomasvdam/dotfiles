# Dotfiles and defaults

Learned the hard way that setting your defaults manually is a bad idea if you ever want to do a clean reinstall...

Initial work mostly based on the work of Mathias Bynens: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles
Later upgraded based on the work of Zach Holman: https://github.com/holman/dotfiles

Both are equally interesting repos to dive into in order to learn more about dotfiles. Mathias' has an extensive .osx file which has a lot of neat tricks.
